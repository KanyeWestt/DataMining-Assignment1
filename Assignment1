Assignment 1
Part B
Brief:
Mine real world dataset regarding Parkinson’s disease for best classification.
Parkinson's = loss of control over muscles and decrease speech quality.
Cure = Speech therapy
Types of classification = class 1 (Improved)/class 2 (unimproved)
Goal = maximize weighted F score for accuracy
Total features: 310
Initial problems = identify which subset of features provide best F score + imbalanced
dataset class 1 has 42 patients and class 2 has 84.
Note: Balancing methods must be applied to improve accuracy.
F_weighted = (F1_1 * nc1 + F1_2 * nc2)/(nc1+nc2)
F1_1 and nc1 is for class 1.
F2_2 and nc2 is for class 2.

(C) Explanation:
Naive Bayes:
From my understanding, Naive Bayes algorithm works by Taking the frequency of each
instance, calculating the probabilities, calculating the posterior probability, and taking the
highest probability will be the outcome of the prediction. It uses all the available data from
the LSVT dataset and predicts through probability. It is very versatile because it can work
with missing values, it is not fussed about irrelevant features, and it is good for text
classification as well. The issue with Naive Bayes is though the prediction from the model is
it has chances of losing accuracy if a categorical variable is missed in the training set, then
the model will assign zero which will negatively impact the overall f score. Knowing this,
Naive Bayes still managed to perform 2nd best from all the other 4 algorithms but only by a
very tiny margin compared to J48 trees.
IBk:
K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) works by looking for the nearest neighbour using the distance
between them. This can be achieved through Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, or the
Hamming distance formulas. Using these 4 different formulas, KNN can work with multiclass problems, usable for Classification and Regression, and can adapt to new problems
thrown at it. Though it performed the best out of all its neighbours (haha), it is not without
flaws. The larger the dataset is the less efficient it becomes. It can suffer with imbalanced
data as it tends to become bias towards the biggest class (specially in a binary). It is also
very sensitive to outliers due to distance being used to classify and it deals very poorly with
missing values. By supplying it 105 different features, it is able to comfortably identify the
best ones and therefore increase the F score greatly, with a difference of 0.1641969 from
the default value of 310 features. In this regard, more features do not necessarily mean a
higher accuracy, as demonstrated by the table above.
J48:
The beauty with J48 is that it has great interpretability due to its natural way of displaying
relationships or affinities between features. When given 5 different features, it has a very
narrow set of instructions or path to follow and hence there would be less pruning involved
compared to a feature with 300 as its value. It performed 3rd best out of the 4 but only
coming in behind Naive Bayes by a very slight amount.
Shannon Imbo - 1303744
OneR:
OneR or one-attribute-rule works by using very simple rules in terms of association.
It simply makes one rule for each of the predictors in the data and picks the one with the
least amount of total error as the rule. It then applies this to the rest of the predictors to yield
the best possible f score. By allowing 5 features, the classifier was able to increase its
accuracy by 5% which is not bad considering how simple this classifier works. It did
however, work poorly compared to its more complicated competitors.

Resampling applied with Z = 700 and B = 0.9 using J48(as per table above):
Shannon Imbo - 1303744
No balancing (resampling) applied:
(D) Explanation:
Both models eventually reach a recall of 1. The difference is the model with balanced and
feature selection has a steadier rate of decrease in precision. The balanced model
understands that not all results are relevant and reaches the recall but precision slowly
decreases. This is a good thing because it is aware that it is making mistakes and it slowly
correcting it while the unbalanced model is completely oblivious to which results or features
are actually relevant and tries to make up for the incorrect predictions at a later rate. A
balanced model with the correct set of features will be able to correct its recalls more
efficiently but also at the expense of precision but at least it is trustworthy compared to a
model using an imbalanced dataset with full features.

Shannon Imbo - 1303744
(A) Explanation:
(a) Assess the impact of meta-learning by comparing the F-weighted value obtained
through meta learning with the value obtained by running each of the 4 algorithms on
the original training dataset. Has it improved accuracy in terms of the F score? (8
marks)
The F score has decreased by a significant amount using both Random Forest and
Multilayer Processing. Using MLP means the layers need to be defined properly otherwise it
won’t be able to use its full potential and the accuracy suffers greatly (as displayed above).
MLP heavily relies on being fine tuned. The amount of layers, the amount of neurons inside
a layer, and setting the weight of each node must be precise otherwise the neural network
will not be as accurate (as displayed here using default values in Weka). Random forest
performed better but still not as good as using a single algorithm.
(B) Explanation:
(b) How important was the choice of meta-learner algorithm in the mining process?
It makes a huge difference which meta-learner algorithm is used. As stated above, MLP is
not very effective if the settings are not finely tuned for the dataset. It is also difficult to use
trial and error with MLP as there are many different options to be tweaked and it is also
considered a black-box and hence it can be difficult to determine the best values for tuning.
Random forest is a lot more versatile and can actually provide a reliable feature importance
estimate. The only drawback for Random Forests is that interpretability can also be a bit
difficult to comprehend and the larger the trees become, the higher the computational costs
(but is not such a big problem with today’s modern technology).
